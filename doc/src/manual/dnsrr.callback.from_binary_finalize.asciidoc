== Name

Module:from_binary_finalize - Finalizes parsing from wire format

== Description

[source,erlang]
----
from_binary_finalize(Terms :: [term()]) -> {ok, Data :: term()}.
----

Finalizes parsing from wire format.

== Arguments

Terms::

The list returned by `Module:from_binary`, in which compressed domains have been resolved

== Return value

Returns a tuple consisting of `'ok'` and the internal resource data.

== Optional callback

If the module can return `{'domains', List}` from link:dnsrr.callback.from_binary{ext-relative}[`Module:from_binary`], and the resource data is structured in *some other way than*:

* If the list has only one member, the first member is used as the resource data
* If there are multiple members in the list, `list_to_tuple` is run on the list and the tuple is used as resource data

then the module must implement this callback. Otherwise it is optional.

== Examples

.Example from dnsrr_soa
[source,erlang]
----
from_binary_finalize([Ns, Contact, Id, Refresh, Retry, Expire, Minimum]) ->
    {ok, {Ns, Contact, Id, ?FIX_TTL(Refresh), ?FIX_TTL(Retry), ?FIX_TTL(Expire), ?FIX_TTL(Minimum)}}.
----

== Changelog

* *0.0.1* Added default behavior, making callback necessary only in unusual cases
* *0.0.0* Callback added
