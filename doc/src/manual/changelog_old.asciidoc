== By module

dnslib 0.0.2 introduces the following backwards incompatible changes:

*dnsfile*

* link:dnsfile.write_resources{ext-relative}[`dnsfile:write_resources/2,3`] option `{'generic', boolean()}` was simplified to just `'generic'`.

*dnslib*

* `dnslib:binary_to_domain/1` was moved to `dnswire` module.
* `dnslib:domain_to_binary/1` was moved to `dnswire` module.
* `dnslib:domain_binary_length/1` was moved to `dnswire` module.

*dnswire*

* link:dnswire.from_binary{ext-relative}[`dnswire:from_binary/1,2`] return format was changed to include a request message with the correct response return code set whenever the error reason was not `'too_short'`. Unlike previously, the returned message is not already a response, but a request, which has to be turned into a response with link:dnsmsg.response{ext-relative}[`dnsmsg:response/1,2`].

*dnszone*

* `dnszone:valid/1` was renamed to link:dnszone.is_valid{ext-relative}[`dnszone:is_valid/1`].
* link:dnszone.new_transfer{ext-relative}[`dnszone:new_transfer/1`] requires different parameters.
* link:dnszone.continue_transfer{ext-relative}[`dnszone:continue_transfer/2`] requires different parameters.
