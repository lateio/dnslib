Check if resource records form a valid zone.

== Arguments

Resources::

Resources to rummage through

== Return value

If `Resources` represent a valid zone, `'true'` is returned.

On error a tuple consisting of `'false'` and the error reason is returned.

== Errors

`'missing_soa'`::

There was no `SOA` record among `Resources`.

`{'multiple_soas', Soas $$::$$ [dnslib:domain()]}`::

There were multiple `SOA` records among `Resources`. `Soas` contains the domain names for additional `SOA` records.

`'wildcard_soa'`::

The `SOA` record has a wildcard domain.

`{missing_glue, Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

`Resources` did not contain glue address record(s) for records past `NS` records. `Domain` is the domain for the record missing glue records.

`{'other_than_glue_past_edges', Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

There were resources other than address records past `NS` records. `Domain` is the domain from the problem record.

`{not_under_soa, Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

A record was not under the `SOA`. `Domain` is the domain of the problem record.

`{'non_exclusive_cname', Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

For some domain, there were both a `CNAME` record and additionally a record of some other type. `Domain` is the domain of the problem record.

`{'cname_to_cname_loop', Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

There was an anomalous `CNAME` record `{Domain, _, _, _, Domain}` in `Resources`.

`{'cname_loop', Domain $$::$$ dnslib:domain()}`::

There was a `CNAME` loop in `Resources`. `Domain` is the starting point of the loop.
